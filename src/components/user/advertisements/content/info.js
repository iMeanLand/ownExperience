                                The site Univers.md includes also, where appropriate, the advertising services that
                                provide users with the information from different advertisements/offers from the
                                advertising partners or information promoters.

                                <br/>

                                The advertising services offered by our site are the paid services and are paid until
                                before the placement of the announcement on the site, depending on the requested
                                advertising service.

                                The site Univers.md does not distribute to the advertising partners or promoters the
                                information that may lead to the identification of the person, unless we have his/her
                                approval.

                                Our advertising policies provide the guidance on the types of content allowed in the
                                advertisements. When the promoters place an order, each advertisement is analysed
                                according to these policies.

                                Before the advertisements appear on our site, they are analysed in order to ensure the
                                compliance with our Advertising policies. Generally, the advertisements are analysed
                                within 24 hours, but sometimes this may last longer.

                                After the analysis of the advertisement, you will receive a notification that will
                                inform whether the advertisement was approved. If it is approved, it will start running
                                and you will be able to see the results in the Administration of advertisements.
